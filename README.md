# CI/CD Pipeline for Stocks Service

## Overview
This project implements a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** for a **finance application** consisting of three services:
1. **Stocks Service** - Handles stock-related operations.
2. **Capital Gains Service** - Computes capital gains based on stock data.
3. **MongoDB Database** - Stores stock-related information.

The pipeline automates building, testing, and executing queries on the application using **Docker**, **Pytest**, and **GitHub Actions**.
